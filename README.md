# Cypress
All tests written in Cypress
tesla_test.js - Written in Cypress. Very basic tests checking for a car model, and some of its textual details. Test fails eventually due to probable automated browser detection. These tests are written purely for practice purposes and without any ill-intentions towards Tesla.
